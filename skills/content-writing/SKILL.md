# Content Writing for Project Descriptions

## Overview

This skill enables writing of project descriptions that communicate business value, outcomes, and impact while deliberately avoiding disclosure of technical implementation details, code logic, or proprietary information.

**Core principle**: Explain **what** the system does and **why** it matters, not **how** it works internally.

## The PAS Framework

All project descriptions should follow the **PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution)** framework for maximum impact and persuasiveness.

### 1. Problem - The Challenge
Define the pain point, gap, or opportunity that the project addresses.

**Guidelines:**
- Start with the user's or business's struggle
- Use concrete, relatable scenarios
- Quantify the problem when possible (time lost, revenue impacted, user friction)
- Keep it concise - 2-3 sentences maximum

**Examples:**
- *"Creating personalized children's storybooks traditionally required expensive artists and weeks of production time, making it inaccessible to most families."*
- *"E-commerce businesses struggle to recover abandoned carts, losing an estimated $18 billion annually in unrealized revenue."*
- *"Healthcare providers spend 40% of their time on documentation instead of patient care, leading to burnout and reduced outcomes."*

### 2. Agitation - The Impact
Amplify the problem by exploring its consequences, emotional weight, and business implications.

**Guidelines:**
- Describe the ripple effects of the problem
- Connect to business KPIs: revenue, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency
- Appeal to both logic (metrics) and emotion (user experience)
- Highlight urgency - why solve this now?
- 3-4 sentences that build the case for action

**Examples:**
- *"This barrier excludes millions of children from the developmental benefits of personalized reading experiences. Parents want to create magical moments with their children, but existing solutions are either mass-produced (lacking personalization) or prohibitively expensive. The result: missed opportunities for early childhood engagement and family bonding."*
- *"Beyond lost revenue, abandoned carts indicate friction in the customer journey. Users show intent but don't complete the purchase, suggesting UX failures, lack of trust, or decision paralysis. Each abandoned cart represents a failed customer experience and wasted acquisition spend."*
- *"The documentation burden doesn't just impact efficiency—it affects patient outcomes. Providers rushing through charts may miss critical details, leading to medical errors. Patients receive less face time, reducing trust and satisfaction. The healthcare system loses billions to administrative overhead instead of investing in care."*

### 3. Solution - The Outcome
Present the project as the solution, focusing entirely on **external outcomes** and **user benefits**—not internal implementation.

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ Describe what users can do / what the system delivers
- ✅ Focus on measurable outcomes and business impact
- ✅ Highlight key features from user perspective
- ❌ NEVER mention algorithms, tech stack, or code logic
- ❌ NEVER reveal internal architecture or proprietary methods
- ❌ NEVER describe implementation details (even at high level)

**Structure:**
1. **Value proposition** - One powerful sentence summarizing the solution
2. **Key capabilities** - 3-5 bullet points on what users can achieve
3. **Business outcomes** - Metrics, KPIs, or impact areas

**Examples:**

**Good (outcome-focused):**
> *"Our AI-powered platform enables families to create fully personalized storybooks in under 5 minutes. Parents simply upload their child's photo and answer a few questions, and receive a beautifully illustrated 24-page storybook featuring their child as the protagonist. The system generates unique character poses, custom illustrations, and professional narration—all automatically and affordably. Early results show 94% customer satisfaction and a 60% increase in repeat engagement compared to traditional books."*

**Bad (implementation-heavy):**
> *"We use OpenAI's DALL-E API with custom prompt engineering to generate character poses in multiple positions. Our microservices architecture includes a pose generation service, compositor service, and audio mixing service orchestrated by Temporal workflows. The system uses Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL..."* ❌

**Good (business-impact focused):**
> *"An intelligent cart recovery system that engages customers at the perfect moment with personalized messaging. By analyzing user behavior patterns, the platform delivers timely reminders, social proof, and targeted incentives that convert abandoned carts into completed purchases. Clients see a 15-25% recovery rate, $50K+ in monthly recovered revenue, and a 3x improvement in customer lifetime value."*

## Writing Checklist

Before finalizing any project description, verify:

- [ ] **Problem is clear**: Can a non-technical audience understand the pain point?
- [ ] **Agitation builds urgency**: Does it make stakeholders feel the importance?
- [ ] **Solution focuses on outcomes**: Are we describing what, not how?
- [ ] **No implementation details**: No mention of APIs, databases, algorithms, or architecture?
- [ ] **No internal logic disclosure**: No explanation of proprietary methods or trade secrets?
- [ ] **Business metrics included**: Are there quantifiable outcomes (revenue, time saved, satisfaction)?
- [ ] **User-centric language**: Is everything phrased from the user/benefit perspective?
- [ ] **Jargon-free**: Would a business stakeholder understand every term?

## Tone and Style Guidelines

### Voice
- **Professional but accessible**: Business-friendly language, not academic or overly casual
- **Confident but not hyperbolic**: State impact clearly without exaggerated claims
- **External-facing**: Write as if the reader is a potential customer, partner, or investor

### Language Patterns to Use
- Action verbs: "Enables," "Delivers," "Transforms," "Accelerates," "Empowers"
- User-centric phrases: "Customers can now..." "The system provides..." "Users experience..."
- Outcome-focused language: "Resulting in..." "Delivering..." "Achieving..."

### Language Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ "We built..." "Our team developed..." → Use "The platform delivers..." "The system enables..."
- ❌ "Using Python/FastAPI/AWS..." → No tech stack mentions
- ❌ "Our algorithm works by..." → No internal logic
- ❌ "The code processes..." → No implementation details
- ❌ "We integrated with..." → No vendor/partner specifics unless public

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Portfolio/Resume Project Description
**Goal**: Showcase your work to recruiters or hiring managers
**Focus**: Business impact, scale, outcomes

**Example:**
> *Built an automated content moderation system processing 10M+ user-generated posts monthly. The solution reduces harmful content exposure by 85% while maintaining 99.2% accuracy, protecting brand safety and user experience. Clients report a 40% reduction in manual moderation costs and 2x faster response times to policy violations.*

### Scenario 2: Executive Summary for Stakeholders
**Goal**: Secure buy-in or report project status
**Focus**: ROI, strategic value, risk mitigation

**Example:**
> *Our customer retention platform proactively identifies at-risk accounts and orchestrates personalized intervention strategies. By analyzing 50+ engagement signals, the system predicts churn 30 days in advance with 89% accuracy. pilot programs show a 22% reduction in customer attrition, representing $1.2M in annual revenue protection. The solution pays for itself within 3 months of deployment.*

### Scenario 3: Marketing/Landing Page Copy
**Goal**: Convert prospects into customers
**Focus**: User benefits, competitive differentiation, social proof

**Example:**
> *Stop losing sales to abandoned carts. Our intelligent recovery platform automatically engages customers who leave without purchasing—delivering the right message at the right time. With personalized recommendations, social proof, and targeted incentives, businesses recover 15-25% of lost revenue. Get started in minutes, not months.

### Scenario 4: Investor Pitch Material
**Goal**: Communicate market opportunity and traction
**Focus**: Market size, problem severity, solution scalability

**Example:**
> *The $18B abandoned cart problem represents the single largest revenue leak in e-commerce. Our platform addresses this with AI-powered engagement that converts intent into action. We've recovered $12M in client revenue to date, with 180% growth over the past year. The system integrates seamlessly with existing platforms, delivering ROI within 90 days for 95% of customers.*

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Never include:**
- Technical diagrams or architecture descriptions
- Code snippets or pseudocode
- Database schemas or API endpoints
- Algorithm explanations (even "we use machine learning to..." is too detailed)
- Proprietary methodologies or trade secrets
- Internal tool names or infrastructure details
- Vendor dependencies (unless publicly known)
- Implementation timelines or technical challenges faced

**Always ask yourself:**
- "Could a competitor benefit from this description?"
- "Does this reveal how we achieve our results?"
- "Would a business stakeholder care about this detail?"

If the answer is yes to the first two or no to the third, remove it.
