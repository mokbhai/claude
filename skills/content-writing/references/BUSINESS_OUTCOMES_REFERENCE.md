## Quantitative vs. Qualitative Metrics

**When to Use Quantitative (Numbers):**
- You have verified data
- Metrics are material to the business
- Numbers tell a compelling story
- Stakeholders care about specific KPIs

**When to Use Qualitative (Descriptive):**
- Early-stage projects without data
- Metrics are difficult to measure
- User experience is the primary outcome
- Quantifying would feel forced or inauthentic

**Example Balancing:**

*Quantitative-heavy:*
> "The platform reduced customer churn by 28%, saving $2.3M annually in recurring revenue. Customer acquisition costs dropped 35% while lifetime value increased 2.1x. Net Promoter Score rose from 42 to 71."

*Qualitative-heavy:*
> "The platform transformed customer relationships from transactional to partnerships. Users report feeling understood and valued, with teams describing deeper empathy for customer needs. The company culture shifted from reactive to proactive, with customer-obsession becoming a core value."

*Balanced approach (recommended):*
> "The platform reduced customer churn by 28%, saving $2.3M annually. Beyond the numbers, customer relationships transformed from transactional to partnerships—users report feeling truly understood, and internal culture shifted to customer-obsession. Net Promoter Score rose from 42 to 71, with qualitative feedback citing 'finally, a company that gets it.'"

## Framing Metrics for Maximum Impact

**Contextualize Numbers:**
- ❌ "We improved performance by 15%"
- ✅ "We improved performance by 15%, translating to $1.2M in annual savings and eliminating 2,500 hours of manual work"

**Use Ranges for Credibility:**
- ❌ "We guarantee 42.37% improvement"
- ✅ "Clients typically see 35-50% improvement, with average results around 42%"

**Anchor to Industry Benchmarks:**
- ❌ "Our churn rate is 5%"
- ✅ "Our churn rate of 5% is half the industry average of 10%, placing us in the top quartile"

**Show Before/After:**
- ❌ "Processing now takes 2 hours"
- ✅ "Processing time dropped from 2 days to 2 hours—a 95% reduction that eliminates weekend work for the team"

**Tie to Strategic Goals:**
- ❌ "We reduced costs by $500K"
- ✅ "We reduced costs by $500K, freeing budget to hire 5 additional engineers and accelerate the product roadmap by 2 quarters"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Claim exact percentages without data to back them
- Use vanity metrics (e.g., "total users" without active user context)
- Overstate impact—round down if anything
- Include competitor comparisons unless publicly verifiable
- Promise future results as if already achieved

**Do:**
- Use ranges when appropriate ("15-20% improvement")
- Qualify metrics ("early results suggest..." or "pilot program showed...")
- Focus on outcomes that matter to stakeholders
- Include timeframe for results ("within 6 months of launch")
- Contextualize metrics with before/after comparisons
