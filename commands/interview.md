description: Interview about an existing plan to refine it further
argument-hint: [plan-file]
---

Read this plan file $1 and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, dependencies, risks, etc.

**Important**: Make sure the questions are not obvious. Focus on uncovering hidden complexity, clarifying ambiguous requirements, and exploring edge cases.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then update the spec with all the new information gathered.

**Note**: For creating new plans with interviews, use `/plan [description]` instead. Use `/interview` to refine existing plans further.
